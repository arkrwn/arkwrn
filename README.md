I am currently working as a Security Engineering Lead, and have been interested in the field of cybersecurity since 2011. In my professional career, I have been involved in system administration and security engineering since 2015, and am currently focusing on devsecops and security management. In my free time, I have been learning bash and python programming and system administration, particularly on Linux, since 2009, and previously learned visual basic from 2007-2009.

I hold the CEH Master certification, which covers both the CEH ANSI and CEH Practical certifications, as well as the AWS Academy Cloud Foundation certification. I have also been a member of the Indonesian Digital Forensics Association since February 2015, the Indonesian Linux User Community in Jakarta from 2014-2017, and have volunteered in the field of IT from 2014-2019.

My areas of expertise include penetration testing, security assessment, including vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, code review, security analysis, devsecops, python and bash programming, Linux administration, and PCI DSS. I am highly enthusiastic about cybersecurity and am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow in this field.
